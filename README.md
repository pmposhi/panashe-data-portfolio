# Panashe Mposhi — Data Portfolio

Welcome to my data portfolio.  
I use Python, Pandas, and SQL to extract insights, solve real-world problems, and communicate findings clearly.  
This portfolio highlights my ability to work with datasets end-to-end — from cleaning and transformation to analysis and interpretation.
